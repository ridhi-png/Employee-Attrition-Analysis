## Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing employee attrition data** using **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning**. The goal is to understand patterns in employee turnover and predict attrition based on features like tenure, performance, and demographics.

Key skills demonstrated:

* Data Analysis & Visualization
* Machine Learning Model Building
* Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

---

## Features

* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize attrition patterns, correlations, and feature distributions.
* **Machine Learning:** Train models to predict employee attrition with performance evaluation.
* **Saved Visualizations:** PNG files of plots for reporting or presentations.

---

## Technologies Used

* Python, Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn for ML
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
